# Cloxpp
This is a compiler written in C for the Clox language made by Robert Nystrom in his book "Crafting Interpreters".
It has some extra features compared to vanilla Clox- as a ++ operator, thus the name Clox++.

It still needs: 
	More tests with more complex classes;
	Class inheritance;
	Some extra cleanup.
